📈 Stock Market Prediction with AdaBoost

🔮 Predict stock market prices using AdaBoost Regression with technical indicators such as RSI, Bollinger Bands, MACD, and Moving Averages! This model helps forecast stock prices, generate trading signals, and visualize future projections.


📌 Features

✅ Fetch Real-Time Data from Yahoo Finance using yfinance.
✅ Train an AdaBoost Regressor with hyperparameter tuning (GridSearchCV).
✅ Evaluate Performance using MSE, MAE, R², Accuracy, and F1 Score.
✅ Generate Buy/Sell/Hold Trading Signals based on predictions.
✅ Predict Future Prices for a given time period.
✅ Visualizations:

    Actual vs. Predicted Prices
    Future Price Projection

🧠 How It Works

1️⃣ Fetch Stock Data → From Yahoo Finance (yfinance).
2️⃣ Feature Engineering → Add indicators like RSI, MACD, Moving Averages.
3️⃣ Preprocessing → Normalize data (StandardScaler).
4️⃣ Train AdaBoost Model → Using DecisionTreeRegressor as the base learner.
5️⃣ Hyperparameter Tuning → Optimize n_estimators & learning_rate.
6️⃣ Evaluate Model → Compute MSE, MAE, R², Accuracy, F1 Score.
7️⃣ Generate Trading Signal → "BUY", "SELL", or "HOLD".
8️⃣ Predict Future Prices → Forecast next N days.
9️⃣ Plot Graphs → Visualize historical & future stock trends.

🔥 Future Enhancements

    🔄 LSTM-based deep learning model for better sequential prediction.
    📡 Real-time data streaming with live market analysis.
    🤖 Improved trading strategy using Reinforcement Learning.
